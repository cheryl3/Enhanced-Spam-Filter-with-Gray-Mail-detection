2. Version : 1.0.0

# Introduction :
Enhanced spam filter with gray mail detection was implemented as my final year project. As the name suggests this 
is a spam filter to distinguish between ham and spam email. However this spam filter goes a step further by detecting
gray email. The implementation is based on a research paper for the same with a little modifications in threshold
values to improve results for my implementation.

# Requirements :
Netbeans 8.0.2 to run your java project.

# Steps :
1. Download the zip file.
2. Create a new java application project in Netbeans. 
3. Put both the files(Detect.java & ScoreGrayCalculation.java) in same package.
4. Build the project.
5. Run Detect.java 
6. Provide text input when asked to enter message.
